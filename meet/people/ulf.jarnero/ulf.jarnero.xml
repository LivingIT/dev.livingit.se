    <bio>I like to describe myself as effective, goal focused and thorough. Since the start of my career I have always strived to develop myself and my skills. I strongly believe that as a person you either grow continuously or you start to decline. I have a solid academic base in computer science, which has benefitted me greatly in my work as a consultant where abstract and many times highly fuzzy ideas needs to be pinned down to clear deliverables.

I have had the opportunity to be part of the entire life cycle of software systems, from the initial specification through the implementation, testing and maintenance, all the way to the dismantling and hand over to the next and better system. These experiences, I believe, have given me a thorough understanding of the software development process.
